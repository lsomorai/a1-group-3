# Introduction
Our group performed the following tasks in this assignment:
- Practiced pair testing
- Conducted exploratory testing on the provided ATM simulation system version 1.0 and 1.1
- Created effective defect reports
- Tracked defects in JIRA
- Executed manual test cases from a formal test suite
- Performed regression testing to verify bug fixes

Before this assignment, our group had experience of testing several school projects, and we now know what we did was mostly exploratory testing and manual functional testing. We haven't used professional bug tracking system or wrote detailed bug reports before.
